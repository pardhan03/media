# ðŸ“š Media Catalog App

A Rust-based media storage application that models a central catalog for managing books, movies, and audiobooks. This project demonstrates key Rust concepts like ownership, borrowing, and structuring data using `struct` and `enum`.

You can:

- Add books with titles and authors
- Add movies with titles and directors
- Add audiobooks with titles only
- Store all media types in a unified catalog
- Perform searches based on title, author, or director

Though the functionality seems simple, the project dives into advanced Rust topics like ownership, references, and memory management â€” making it a great learning experience for intermediate Rust developers.
